Meeting agenda:
	+ Maybe go over LSURC presentation
	+ Go over todos
	+ Iterate on experimental design
	+ discuss possible pub venues

8 tokens = 40s, 1 min conservative
100 tokens = 12.5m, 20m conservative

minpair analysis = done
recording = done ** but many are too quiet
difference in vib style && Playing with diff word/stimuli combos:
	- can feel freq differences, defs a peak response in terms of 200-1000Hz, it can get painful if too loud and high freq
	- 
	- Would be interesting to do a high pass filter and supplement high freq information (since that is commonly often lost in sensioneural hearing loss)
- Time budget: 1 hour, 
		budget 30m to go through 100 tokens
		Calibration sequence: budget 15m. Suggest we do this automatically
- Body locations: agree with neck and hands

Time breakdown:
+ 15m introduction, sign papers
+ 15m calibration
+ 30m main task (will really be 20m)
	- Note: if we want to do within subjects we could probably break it down to 50 tokens with one vib style, 50 tokens with another vib style


Equalize power under curve between tadoma + lowfi
	- for lowfi sine wave, take area under curve of high-fi--then make the lowfi token's amp match the high fi

Criteria for in/exclusion of pairs:
- prune minimal pair corpus: open vs closed vowels (amp distinction)
						- +v vs -v for stops, fricatives, lowfi+highfi

- fine if mps are all onset

- headmounted mic for recording
	- remove mid vowels--go for high contrast btwn vowels

	- high vs low (vowels) <10 tokens for each?>
	- voice vs unvoiced (stops) ** drop?
	- voice vs unvoiced (fricatives) ** longer so may have a greater effect

	- nasal vs oral (nasalized vowels) ** drop?

	- and similar numbers of minimal pairs	
	- use monosyl.
	-  

struct: 2x3x4??? 
no of observations within subjects: 10 per condition (at least)
240 trials

Bringing it down: collapse contrasts...
				  only do 2 or 3 contrasts?

TODOs: ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	- Try and ID trials I can afford with budget
	- Can we cram in 240 trials in our budget?
	   - if we can't drop some contrasts, #1 is stops, #2 nasals 
	- power analysis? 
	- Prelim on N=12, aim for N=24
	- Analyze where biggest distinctions in amplitude are after recording and observing sine wave
